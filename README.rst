Rain in Midtown Manhattan
=========================

This project contains an image classifier trained on images from
a camera in Midtown Manhattan and weather data from a weather
station located in Central Park. The goal is to predict whether
it is raining or not at the location of the camera given a still
image.

This is a work in progress.
